# Style and appearance

Styles and appearance of the Header work based on CSS class. You need a style sheet to apply styles to the Header control, ej.mobile.all.min.css.

## Customize styles

To change the color or design of the Header control appearance, you can override default styles of the Header control by using its class names. The following are specific class names you can use to modify styles and appearance of the Header.
