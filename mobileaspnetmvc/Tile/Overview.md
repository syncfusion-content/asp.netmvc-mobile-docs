# Tile

The Essential Studio for ASP.NET MVC Mobile Tile widget is a simple, opaque display of colored rectangles or squares that are arranged on the Start screen in a grid-like pattern. Tapping (or otherwise selecting) a tile launches the app or other functionality that is represented by the tile.

## Key features

* Text and Image: Supports both text and images as toolbar content.
* Badge support: You can update the Badge value dynamically to show the notifications.
