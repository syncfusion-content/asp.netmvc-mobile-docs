# DatePicker

The EssentialStudio for ASP.NET MVC,MobileDatePicker widget provides support to display the picker element within your web page and allows you to pick the date. The DatePicker displays the dates of the current month with the current date highlighted and you can customize the date format, restrict the selectable date ranges, and localize the culture to change the language of the DatePicker.

## Key Features

* Min and Max date range: This feature allows the selectable date ranges to be restricted.
* Date Format and Localization: The DatePicker control uses Globalize.js, a simple JavaScript library that allows you to globalize and localize the format and dates in a culture-specific fashion. This Globalize.js is found onÂ [GitHub](https://github.com/jquery/globalize).
