# Overview

The Essential Studio for ASP.NET MVC Mobile MaskEdit control provides an easy and reliable way of collecting user input and displaying standard data in a specific format. Some common uses of the MaskEdit control are IP address editors, phone number editors, and Social Security number editors. 

## Key features

Mask- The format where the value should be entered in the Textbox is set by using this property.

Watermark Text- The MaskEdit Textbox supports watermarking. A watermark is background text that appears in the Textbox without interfering with user text entry or the readability of the text entered. It can be used to display a ready instruction or other important information. It appears automatically before the text is entered and disappears once you enter the text.
