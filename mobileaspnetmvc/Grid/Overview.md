# Grid

The Mobile Grid control for Essential Studio ASP.NET MVC is an efficient display engine for tabular data in mobile devices. It renders from a datasource, such as array of JSON objects, OData web services, or ej.DataManager, binding data fields to columns and displaying a column header to identify the field. This grid is very useful for generating complex grid-based report. The most important features available in the Mobile Grid control for ASP.NET MVC are paging, sorting, scrolling and filtering.

## Key Features

* Data sources: Binds the Grid control with an array of JSON objects or ej.DataManager.
* Filtering: Supports filtering the data.
* Paging: Provides an option to easily switch between pages using the pager bar.
* Sorting: Supports sorting the data.
